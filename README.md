The tools used in this challenge were the following:

1. VS Code: You will use a text editor to create and edit HTML and JavaScript files.

2. Web browser: You will use a web browser, such as Chrome, to view, inspect, and debug your visualizations. 

We will use Chrome in our examples.

3. Command-line interface: You will use the command-line interface to run a local server. If you're a Mac user, this means Terminal. If you're a Windows user, you'll be using Git Bash.

4. GitHub: As you will deploy your final data visualization on GitHub Pages, you will need your GitHub account.
